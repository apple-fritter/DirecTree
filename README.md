# DirecTree
This script recursively traverses through a specified directory (or defaults to / if no directory is provided) and generates a file tree representation using Unicode characters to depict the hierarchy.

The generated file tree is output to a text file named tree.txt, which is saved in the same directory as the script.

## Usage
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apple-fritter/DirecTree.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd DirecTree
```

Run the script:
```bash
./tree.sh
```

If you want to specify a different directory, you can provide the path as an argument:
```bash
./tree.sh /path/to/directory
```

The file tree will be generated, and a file named tree.txt will be created in the same directory as the script.

## Example Output
Below is an example output generated by the script:

```
. (current directory)
├─── documents
│   ├─── text_documents
│   │   ├─── notes.txt
│   │   └─── draft.txt
│   └─── spreadsheets
